- Any special details on how to compile your project?


- Any special details on how to run your project?
Start from the accessPage.html, this is where you will enter in information to access your database.
When it is done you will be redirected to the mainPage.html where you can add recipes, add ingredients,
list ingredients, and buy ingredients.

- Any bugs your project has, and possible fixes to those bugs?
The bug I have is that the program can't update the tables for the Inventory when trying to buy the
ingredients for a recipe.

- An overview of how you solved the project?
For the project I did first adding and creating recipes, which I then could work on listing the ingredients for
a recipe. After that I focused on adding ingredients to the Inventory table and from that tried to make the 
buy ingredients fuction to work.
